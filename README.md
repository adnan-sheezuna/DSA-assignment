## Stack and Queue Implementation Using Linked List
### Purpose of the Code
`This project implements two fundamental data structures, Stack and Queue, using linked lists. It aims to deepen understanding of:`

`Linked list operations such as node insertion and deletion.`
`Core data structure principles, including Last In, First Out (LIFO) for stacks and First In, First Out (FIFO) for queues.`
## How to Run the Program
### Clone the repository:

`git clone <repository_url>`
`cd <repository_folder>`
### Compile and run the code:

#### .For Python:
`python main.py`
`For C++:`
`g++ main.cpp -o main`
`./main`
#### .For Java:

`javac Main.java`
`java Main`
`Follow the on-screen instructions to test the stack and queue operations.`

### Time Complexity ###
#### Stack Operations: ####
#### Push (Add Element): 
𝑂
(
1
)
`O(1) - A new node is inserted at the head.`
#### Pop (Remove Element): 
𝑂
(
1
)
`O(1) - The head node is deleted.`
#### Peek (View Top Element): 
𝑂
(
1
)
`O(1) - The head node is accessed directly.`
### Queue Operations:
#### Enqueue (Add Element): 
𝑂
(
1
)
`O(1) - A new node is inserted at the tail.`
#### Dequeue (Remove Element): 
𝑂
(
1
)
`O(1) - The head node is deleted.`
`Peek (View Front Element): `
𝑂
(
1
)
`O(1) - The head node is accessed directly.`
